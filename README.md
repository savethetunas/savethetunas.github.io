Made the site fluid by using clamp function to rezise the text.  
Added ul/li to stack kelp elements while still being able to apply animations  
Added animation delay timer to stagger animation.  
Fixed padding-set 0  
Fixed margins-set 0  
Added sandy "noise" to mimic the style Sweigart used on his command line version  
Next I want to add fishies, bubbles, more kelp structers.  
Fishies need animation to swim across the screen.  
Bubbler has to bring in air.  
Three more kelp structures.
