Made the site fluid by using clamp function to rezise the text.  
Added ul/li to stack kelp elements while still being able to apply animations  
Added animation delay timer to stagger animation.  
Fixed padding-set 0  
Fixed margins-set 0  
Added sandy "noise" to mimic the style Sweigart used on his command line version  
Next I want to add fishies, bubbles, more kelp structers.  
Fishies need animation to swim across the screen.  
Bubbler has to bring in air.  
Three more kelp structures.  
4/30  
We got a fishy in the tank, repeat fishy is in the tank.
Cant apply anything but backround color on hover if the element already has an animation.  
To-DO  
bubbles  
kelp structure
fishy pals  
5/4  
added and removed fishies and kelps and probably bubbles.  
they look nice but are craptastic on less powerfull devices.  
added jelly fish
